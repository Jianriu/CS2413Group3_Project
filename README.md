# CS2413Group3_Project 
This is the guide I followed to setup this web application project: https://www.infoworld.com/article/3619031/build-a-java-application-in-visual-studio-code.html

## Prerequisites
1. Java
2. Install Maven 

## Locations 
 * demo folder: contains all the back end code, which is in Java.
 * vs-java-frontend folder: contains all the front-end code, which is written in JavaScript and HTML. 

 ## Quick Setup 
  1. Go into a terminal and go to the CS2413Group3_Project/demo directory. type this command in: "mvn spring-boot: run". This should run the backend at localhost:5000. You can change the port number in application.properties file. 

  2. Create a new terminal and go to the CS2413Group3_Project/vs-java-frontend directory. type this command in: "npm dev". This should run the front-end portion at localhost:8080 (if it doesnt work run: npm install before running npm dev??)
